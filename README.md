1. Start by running the server.py in a terminal window with the port as the argument.

2. The server will then go in listen-mode and wait for connections and let us know if somebody connects.

3. Open up at least one terminal for a bot, or as many as you see fit. Keep in mind that there are only 3 bots to choose from: Sifan, Noah and Miki

4. One must also open one terminal for the host-client
Start client.py in the new terminals with 3 arguments: IP-address, port and name. Any bot name other than the given ones will result the client running as a host

5. After this the chat room will be started and one can ask questions and the bots will respond



6. Type "QUIT" from host terminal to disconnect or close the terminal.

7. To run the server go to the directory where you have the server.py file and type server.py (port number) on terminal window
8. To run a client go to the directory where you have the client.py file and type client.py (ip-address, port  number, name) on terminal window
